# quadcopter_hippo_sim
Test simulation environment for a quadcopter, and maybe later the hippocampus underwater robot. For testing motor failure.
**TODO**: Implement visualization using 3D pyplot. Implement the motor failure situation described in the paper, and maybe also some other control policy to get the vehicle to move.
